          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the
          languages of the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
          language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
          of a <em>webpage</em> (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
          understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The opening tag | this message is bold and its color is changed
            through psuedo class li:
          </li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You can learn more at the

        </p>
        <h3 class="why-html">Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
          the web. Here are 5 of them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To be able to use the fundamental web dev language | this message is
            bold and its color is changed through psuedo class li:
          </li>
          <li>
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
            Worpress or Wix
          </li>
          <li>To build web applications</li>
          <li>To impress friends</li>
          <li>To have fun üòÉ</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
